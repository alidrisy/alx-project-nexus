# Project Nexus – ProDev Backend Engineering

Welcome to **Project Nexus**, a documentation hub capturing the key learnings, concepts, tools, and experiences gained throughout the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.

This repository is designed to serve as a **reference guide** for backend development and a **collaboration point** for both backend and frontend learners within the ProDev community.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

- Consolidate major learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and practical solutions.
- Serve as a long-term reference for learners and developers.
- Promote collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

### 🔧 Technologies Covered

- **Python** – Core language for backend logic, scripting, and API development.
- **Django** – High-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – Powerful toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **GraphQL** – Flexible query language for APIs (via Graphene-Django).
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD** – Continuous Integration and Deployment using GitHub Actions.

### 🧩 Backend Development Concepts

- **Database Design**
  - Relational DB modeling (PostgreSQL)
  - Normalization and relationships (OneToOne, ForeignKey, ManyToMany)
- **Asynchronous Programming**
  - Async views in Django
  - Celery + RabbitMQ for background tasks
- **Caching Strategies**
  - Redis-based caching
  - Caching views, queries, and serialized data

---

## 🧪 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Handling long-running tasks | Integrated **Celery** with **RabbitMQ** to offload and monitor background jobs. |
| API performance issues | Applied **query optimization**, caching, and **pagination** in DRF. |
| Docker deployment issues | Created multi-stage **Dockerfiles** and used **Docker Compose** for orchestration. |
| Frontend-backend integration | Used **Postman** and **OpenAPI** docs to test and align API contracts. |

---

## ✅ Best Practices & Takeaways

- **Design First**: Start with clear API specifications using tools like Swagger or Postman.
- **Write Tests**: Always include unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Use Linters & Formatters**: Maintain code quality with `black`, `flake8`, and pre-commit hooks.
- **Follow Git Workflow**: Use feature branches and meaningful commit messages.
- **Document Everything**: Maintain detailed docstrings and project documentation.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Hub

Project Nexus emphasizes collaboration with:

### 🧑‍💻 ProDev Backend Learners
- Share solutions, tools, and system design ideas.
- Organize code review or debug sessions.

### 🎨 ProDev Frontend Learners
- Align API requirements.
- Provide backend support for data consumption and UI testing.
